*** Version 0.6 - 2005-08-23 ***

* Improved performance: No longer hogs 100% CPU even when idle, and
  stays at 0% during expert play on my 1.7Ghz Pentium

* Added command-line arguments to specify the board size, as well as
  presets for beginner, intermediate, and expert, and an option to use
  or not use the '?' ``mark'', as well as a usage message

* F2 now starts a new game, like on Windows

* The timer now properly stops at 999

* The cheat now continues to toggle after game over

* The cheat now requires right shift at the end of the combination,
  like on Windows

* Palettized all the bitmaps, significantly reducing size on disk

* Some minor code cleanup and beautification, including an attack of
  80-column OCD.

* `make clean' now actually deletes the .o

*** Version 0.56 - 2005-08-07 ***

* Middle-click now functions like a both-click. Thanks to Simon Biber
  pointing out it should.


*** Version 0.55 - 2005-05-26 ***

* Added ctrl-click (CMD-click on OS X) to function like a both-click

* Added the cheat Easter egg, almost the same as on Windows, but with
  two distinctions:
  - It uses (0,0) of the game board, not the monitor
  - It doesn't require the `shift' at the end of the combo

*** Version 0.50 - 2005-05-09 ***

* Initial release
